### 🚀 This repository contains a basic layout project for a web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal is to provide a simple and responsive framework for web application development.

### 🚀🧠 The index.html file contains the HTML code for the page. The assets directory contains the CSS and JavaScript files needed for the page to function. The assets/css/layout.css file contains the page styling. The assets/js/script.js file contains the JavaScript code to control the navigation menu. How to use it To use the layout in your project, just copy the HTML code from the index.html file and add the assets directory to your project. You also need to add the link to the CSS file and the JavaScript script in your HTML
